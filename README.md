# openaigptinpython
This code will help you create a GPT based chatbot using python to run on google colab 

This program uses the OpenAI API to generate follow-up questions. The API is a way for computer programs to access OpenAI's powerful language model, which can understand and generate text.

The program first defines a function called "generate_followup" that takes a prompt (a sentence or phrase) as input. The function uses the OpenAI API to generate a follow-up question to the prompt, and then returns that question as output.

The program then enters a loop that continuously prompts the user for input (using the "input" function). For each input the user provides, the program generates a follow-up question by calling the "generate_followup" function and passing in the user's input as the prompt. It then prints the follow-up question to the screen using the "print" function.

The loop continues indefinitely until the program is stopped (by pressing Ctrl+C or closing the terminal window).

Overall, this program could be used as a simple chatbot that generates follow-up questions based on what the user says.
